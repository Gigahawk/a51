0.5.6 -- New misc.c. Speed improved. link51.mak - /DHEAP_DBG=1
         Changed collect.c -- VALIDATE_HEAP_PTR is commented out
	 as this is the major cause of the big slow down of the debug ver.
0.5.5 -- Major bug: ProcessFixup() doesn't add the offset of the
	 fixup so failed (_extern+1) for example. Fixed!
0.5.4 -- Major bug: In process.c ProcessModule() worked with an invalid
	 nExternIndex. This worked if all the externs were defined before
	 any publics. Fixed!
      -- BuildOutputFileName() failed to build proper file name under
         some vague circumstances, Fixed!
0.5.3 -- ??LAST_DATA instead of __LAST_DATA
0.5.2 -- Bug: invalid output file name. Fixed!
      -- __LAST_DATA extern resolved.
0.5.1 -- Bug: PrepareDSeg() failure to combine dseg chunks as the
         bit segment start is improperly checked. Fixed!
0.5.0 -- "Smart dseg" option added.
0.4.1 -- Checking for same segments for	an extern/public pair.
