== a51

* +a51+ is a portable assembler for 8051, written in C.
* +link51+ is the companion linker capable of producing .bin and .hex files.
* +objdump5+ decodes an object file into human-readable form.

== Building

+a51+ builds under Linux and Windows using CMake. It can also be built for DOS with Borland C 3.1 and
Borland Make.

The build produces several executables:

* +a51+ is the assembler.
* +link51+ is the linker
* +mlink+ is a minilinker used to test the assembler - it produces a usable binary from a single object file.
* +objdump5+ is self explanatory

=== Linux and Windows

You will need +CMake+ 2.6 or later. +Bison+ is optionally required for generating the parser, but a
pre-generated parser is included in the source.

To build, enter the project directory and execute the following commands:

----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DGENERATE_SRC=0 ..
make
----

To re-generate the Bison parser (and other internal tables), change the +cmake+ command line
above to +-DGENERATE_SRC=1+.

On Windows, omit the last +make+. CMake on Windows generates a Visual Studio project
file, which can be open it with Visual Studio and built normally normally from there. CMake can
also generate an +NMake+ makefile and other formats (see the CMake documentation).

=== DOS

The source includes makefiles for Borland C 3.1 for DOS. They will likely also work with different
Borland C versions, but as of this writing have only been tested with that version (inside DOSBOX).

To build, enter the project directory. Examine and possibly change +lib/common/makefile.bc+ - it
contains a reference to the installation directory of Borland C, which may be different.  Then
execute the following commands:

----
cd lib/common
make -f makefile.bc
cd ..
cd mlink
make -f makefile.bc
cd ..
cd a51
make -f makefile.bc
cd ..
cd link51
make -f makefile.bc
----

The option to re-generate the parser and other tables has been disabled in the DOS build
because of practical inability to test it. It requires installing DJGPP and Bison for
DOS, which goes beyond this author's pain threshold.

+objdump51+ can easily be compiled for DOS, but at this time there is no makefile.

== Assembling The Examples

The directory +examples/+ contains simple examples to demonstrate the usage of
the assembler and linker. There is a GNU Makefile to assemble and
link them. It needs the variable +BUILD+ to point to the project build
directory.

From the project root:

----
export BUILD=$PWD/build
cd examples
make
----

On non-Unix OSes the examples can be assembled manually by directly
invocing +a51+ and +link51+.
