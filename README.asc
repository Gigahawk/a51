== a51

+a51+ is a portable assembler for 8051, written in C.

== Building

The source has been updated to build under Linux and Windows using CMake. You will need CMake 2.6.
Bison is optionally required for generating the parser, but a pre-generated parser is included in
the source.

To build, enter the project directory and
execute the following commands:

----
mkdir output
cd output
cmake -DGENERATE_SRC=0 ..
make
----

To re-generate the Bison parser (and other internal tables), change the +cmake+ command line
above to +-DGENERATE_SRC=1+.

On Windows, omit the last +make+. By default on Windows CMake generates a Visual Studio project
file. Open it with Visual Studio and build normally.

Two executables are produced: +output/src/a51+ and +output/mlink/mlink+.

+a51+ is the assembler. +mlink+ is a minilinker used to test the assembler.
It produces a usable binary from a single object file.

The source also includes outdated makefiles for DOS (Borland C 3.1 and DJGPP) and Windows (Visual C 4).
They haven't been tested recently, but can be made to work with minimal amount of effort, if
anybody cared.
