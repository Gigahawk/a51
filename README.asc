== a51

+a51+ is a portable assembler for 8051, written in C.

== Building

The source contains outdated makefiles for DOS (Borland C 3.1 and DJGPP)
and Windows (Visual C 4). They haven't been tested recently, but they
can presumably be made to work without much effort, if anyone cared to do it.

More recently the source has been updated to build under Linux using CMake.
CMake 2.6 or newer is required. To build, enter the project directory and
execute the following commands:

----
mkdir output
cd output
cmake ..
make
----

Two executables are produced: +output/src/a51+ and +output/mlink/mlink+.

+a51+ is the assembler. +mlink+ is a minilinker used to test the assembler.
It produces a usable binary from a single object file.
